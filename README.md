Convert LaTeX file to ODT, DOC, or PDF (outdated)

I wrote this utility script in 2007 to help convert my LaTeX documents to the
MS Word format, OpenOffice ODT format, and PDF. I also added a script to run
these conversion automatically on a directory tree.

This program is outdated; I moved to [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) for all my
document conversion needs as it more general and, over-all, a lot better than
these simple helper scripts. Still, someone might have a use for it.
